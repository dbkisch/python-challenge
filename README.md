# python-challenge

This repo contains two assigments: PyBank and PyPoll, as described below:

Assignment#1: PyBank
A new python script, "main.py", was created to read in a financial dataset called "budget_data.csv" from the Resources folder, 
and output analysis to the terminal as well as the analysis folder as "budget analysis.txt".

The script calculates each of the following values:
*The total number of months included in the dataset
*The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
*The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes
*The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
*The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

I leveraged some input from my TA, Dwight, regarding the formatting for the PyBank currency output.

Assignment #2: PyPoll
A new python script, "main.py" was created to read in a set of polling data called "election_data.csv" from the Resources folder,
and output analysis to the terminal as well as the analysis folder as "election_analysis.txt".

The script calculates each of the following values:
*The total number of votes cast
*A complete list of candidates who received votes
*The percentage of votes each candidate won
*The total number of votes each candidate won
*The winner of the election based on popular vote
